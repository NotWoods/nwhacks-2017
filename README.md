## Inspiration
We were interested in learning how to work with Amazon Web Services to
program an app on Amazon Echo and Alexa AI.

## What it does
It is a voice based interaction game.
It allows the user to play it hands free while they are doing chores, work, etc.
The content is also child friendly and amusing to a broad audience.

## Challenges we ran into
When we got the game running on the Echo,
we realized that some of the storyâ€™s lines did not sound fluid when spoken by
Alexa.
